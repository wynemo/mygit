 # 使用 Gemini CLI 查找问题

  When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
  context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

  ## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

  Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
   gemini command:

  ### Examples:

  **Single file analysis:**
  ```bash
  gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

  Multiple files:
  gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

  Entire directory:
  gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

  Multiple directories:
  gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

  Current directory and subdirectories:
  gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
